My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "The effect of TFEB upregulation in melanoma\nChengyu Liang Lab\nTFEB is a master transcription factor of autophagy-lysosomal function and has been observed to have both tumor suppressive and tumor supportive roles with different types of cancers. We hypothesized that TFEB inhibition may contribute to oncogenic growth in melanomas. To test this hypothesis we used a tamoxifen-inducible TFEB syngeneic model with subcutaneously injected melanoma cell lines. My results indicated TFEB overexpression led to significantly smaller tumor sizes and no difference in survival rate between the two groups. The implications of these results may support pharmacological activation of TFEB as a therapeutic approach to improve current treatments for melanoma patients.\nPublications Quach C, Song Y, Guo H, Li S, Maazi H, Fung M, Sands N, O’Connell D, Restrepo-Vassalli S, Chai B, Nemecio D, Punj V, Akbari O, Idos GE, Mumenthaler SM, Wu N, Martin SE, Hagiya A, Hicks J, Cui H, Liang C.

    "text": "Exploring Zelda’s function in Central Nervous System Development\nChristine Rushlow Lab\nZelda is a master transcription factor required for early embryogenesis in Drosophila that localizes to the central nervous system (CNS) during mid to late stages. However the precise role of Zelda in CNS development was unknown. We explored this using RNA interference and “enhancer trap” P-insertion elements to disrupt Zelda expression and potentially locate the CNS enhancer. Results indicated that two of the six P element lines had higher reporter gene specificity to the CNS and were within 600bp of each other, supporting the conclusion that they may lie within proximity of the CNS enhancer for Zelda. This research expands on the known properties of Zelda, which has been proven to be analogous to that in other organisms during their respective embryonic development, and therefore has broader applications to the developmental field."
